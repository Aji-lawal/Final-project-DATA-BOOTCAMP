# Final-project-DATA-BOOTCAMP
●	Imported heart failure data from Kaggle and used Python to try to find the best parameters to predict and visualize the likelihood of death in patients with heart disease and measure the effectiveness of these parameters
●	Results indicated that the parameters we chose; serum creatinine and ejection fraction in tandem with other factors are useful, they just cannot be used individually. We found that both correlations are low, which suggests that this would not be an efficient metric.
